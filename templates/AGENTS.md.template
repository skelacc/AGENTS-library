# Agents Documentation

This document lists all available agents in the system. Each agent is a specialized assistant that handles specific tasks automatically. Use these agents to streamline your workflow and automate repetitive tasks.

## Quick Start

To activate an agent, simply use one of its trigger phrases in your conversation. Agents are always listening and will automatically respond when they detect relevant requests.
